gimbal controller

  rates / integrated-rates
  width+proportional+integral control list for pitch/yaw
  PI controls for endstop algo?
  final rates are prop + integral + drift
  manual drift at first, then auto?

  Fix endstop algo
    bounce
    stuck past edges with low gain, very bounce at high gain
    try softer edges

UI for gimbal debug
  - some graphs, with refresh re-request hook

Gimbal tuning
  - Parameter tuning tool
  - Zero out roll axis
